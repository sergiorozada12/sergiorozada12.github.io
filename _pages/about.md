I am a proud Asturian who spent most of his teenage years as a handball goalkeeper, trying to make it to the professional level. Spoiler: it didn't quite work. At some point I realized that engineering hurt less and actually gave me the same kind of thrill, so I swapped the goalpost for equations.

I studied Electronics and Control Engineering and started out at ArcelorMittal Research, working on robotics and additive manufacturing. That is when I discovered how much I enjoyed building systems that learn from data. I moved to London for a master’s in Data Science and then joined industry to build data products. At BBVA I worked on tools for personal financial management. Later at Seedtag I helped create contextual intelligence systems and dealt with machine learning at scale. After that I worked at Meta, collaborating across teams on large scale data infrastructure and models.

In parallel I pursued a PhD in reinforcement learning and found that I really enjoy academic work. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Antonio G. Marques on efficient methods for reinforcement learning, and I spent a research stay in Alejandro Ribeiro’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Now I am an Assistant Professor at URJC in the Department of Signal Theory, where I teach signal processing and machine learning. My research focuses on the interplay between data, models, and optimization, with the goal of understanding and controlling dynamical systems.
