I studied Electronics and Control Engineering and spent my first professional steps at ArcelorMittal Research, working in robotics and additive manufacturing. That is where I realized how much I enjoyed building systems that learn from data. I moved to London for a master’s in Data Science and then joined the industry to build data products. At BBVA I worked on advanced tools for personal financial management. Later at Seedtag I helped build contextual intelligence, dealing with machine learning systems at scale. After that I worked at Meta, collaborating across teams on large scale data infrastructure and models.

In parallel I pursued a PhD in reinforcement learning and discovered that I really enjoy academic work. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Antonio G. Marques on efficient methods for reinforcement learning, and I did a research stay in Alejandro Ribeiro’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania. I am now an Assistant Professor at URJC in the Department of Signal Theory. I teach signal processing and machine learning. My research looks at the interplay between data, models, and optimization, with an eye toward understanding and controlling dynamical systems.
